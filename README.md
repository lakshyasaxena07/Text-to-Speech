# **Text-to-Speech Web Application**

## **Description**

This **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Web Application** allows users to convert any text input into speech audio using a simple and user-friendly interface. The project leverages modern web technologies to provide a seamless experience for users looking to transform written text into audible speech. The application is responsive and works well across different devices.

---

## **Features**

- **Text Input**: Users can enter any text into a textarea input.
- **Speech Conversion**: The app converts the input text into speech with just one click.
- **Audio Playback**: The generated speech audio can be played directly within the application.
- **Dynamic UI**: Interactive and intuitive user interface with clear buttons and alerts for ease of use.
- **Error Handling**: Alerts users if no text is provided or if an issue occurs during the text-to-speech conversion process.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the application with a clean and modern look.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: For handling events, making API requests, and updating the DOM.
- **Fetch API**: Used for sending text data to the server and receiving the speech audio response.
- **Backend**: Expected to include an API endpoint (`/tts`) for processing text-to-speech conversion.

## **How to Use**

Follow these steps to set up and use the Text-to-Speech Web Application:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Download the project files to your local system using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-to-speech.git
 2. **Install Requirements**
    Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run the Backend**
   Start the backend server using the main.py script:
   ```bash
     python main.py
The Flask application will host the /tts API endpoint for text-to-speech conversion. By default, it runs on http://localhost:5000.

# **Files Included**
- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the application.
- **style.css**: The CSS file for styling the application.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file for handling user interactions and text-to-speech conversion.
- **Backend API**: Expected to include a `/tts` endpoint for speech conversion (not included in this repository).

---

## **Backend Functionality**
- The `/tts` endpoint should accept a POST request containing the text to convert into speech.
- The backend should process the text using a Text-to-Speech engine (e.g., Google Text-to-Speech API, pyttsx3, or Amazon Polly) and return the generated speech as an audio file.
- The frontend fetches this audio file, allowing users to play it directly on the browser.

---

## **Requirements**
- A web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- An active server hosting the `/tts` API endpoint for processing the text-to-speech request.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Support for multiple languages and voices.
- Options to adjust speech rate, pitch, and volume.
- Offline mode using browser-based text-to-speech APIs.
- Enhanced error handling and debugging.
